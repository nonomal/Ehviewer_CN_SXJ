                               target="_blank">A new search engine has been deployed</a>. Updates
                            and discussion related to this go in that thread.<br><br><br><b>2022-09-26</b><br><br>-
                            Three new image servers have been deployed to a secondary location,
                            replacing the single server there which was running out of
                            space.<br><br><br><b>2022-09-12</b><br><br>- Added separate report types
                            for reporting excessive updates and requesting gallery
                            splits/reversions.<br><br><br><b>2022-08-07</b><br><br>- Adjusted the
                            "peak hours" used by original image downloading to better match the
                            actual measured peak periods. It is now between 14:00 and 20:00 UTC
                            Monday-Saturday, and between 05:00 and 20:00 UTC on Sundays.
                            <br><br><br><b>2022-07-27</b><br><br>- Corrected an issue with the image
                            dispatch logic where it would not always avoid servers internally
                            flagged as offline.<br><br><br><b>2022-07-04</b><br><br>- Updated the
                            backend image fetch logic to make better use of the new topology,
                            especially if a server is offline for any reason.<br><br><br><b>2022-06-28</b><br><br>-
                            Three new (original) image servers are now live, one for expanding the
                            capacity at one location and two (re-)adding coverage to a different
                            location.<br><br><br><b>2022-06-07</b><br><br>A couple of minor tweaks
                            to the "Download source image" changes, since it dropped the utilization
                            by a lot more than we needed it to:<br><br>- It no longer applies to
                            galleries posted in the last <strike>7</strike> 30 days.<br><br>- It no
                            longer applies for donators.<br><br><br><b>2022-06-06</b><br><br>- Using
                            the "Download source image" function will now consume GP during peak
                            hours. "Peak hours" for this purpose is (in UTC) weekdays between 14:00
                            and 20:00, and weekends between Saturday 14:00 until Sunday 20:00. This
                            will also be used outside of peak hours if the image viewing limit is
                            exhausted.<br><br>The GP cost is the same as what it would be for
                            resetting the image limit, and also the same as the archiver cost for
                            including it in an archive for a donator.<br><br>For database health
                            reasons, this function will consume 1000 GP at a time, adding a "hidden"
                            full image quota which is drawn from until it is
                            exhausted.<br><br><br><b>2022-06-05</b><br><br>- Added fields to the API
                            with the GID and key for a gallery's parent gallery (if it has one), the
                            first gallery in the chain (if it's different from the queried gallery),
                            and the current/active gallery in the chain (if it's different from the
                            queried gallery).<br><br>- The uploader name for recently published
                            disowned galleries is now also shown in <i>italic</i> to better
                            distinguish it from the "visited link"
                            color.<br><br><br><b>2022-05-11</b><br><br>- Minimum requirements for
                            new H@H clients were updated. They now need a throttle of 2000 KB/s (up
                            from 1000 KB/s) and a hourly bandwidth limit of 1000 MB (up from 300
                            MB). This is not retroactive.<br><br><br><b>2022-05-06</b><br><br>-
                            Fixed an issue with the Autotagger where if the master of a tag group
                            changed multiple times, and the former-master-current-slave tag was
                            upvoted by Autotagger itself, it wouldn't update the tags to reflect the
                            new master.<br><br><br><b>2022-04-28</b><br><br>- <a rel="nofollow"

                                the "Defaced" expunge type.</a><br><br>- Added expunge type
                            filtering to the expunge tracker along with some other minor filtering
                            improvements.<br><br>- When a tag is vetoed, the system will now only
                            apply a tagging penalty if the tag was recent, mimicking the behavior
                            for normally downvoted tags. (This prevents people from being penalized
                            if the definition of a tag
                            changes.)<br><br><br><b>2022-04-25</b><br><br>- Reclass tags are now
                            hidden from the tag pane if there is just one reclass tag with positive
                            tagging score and it matches the current category of the gallery, unless
                            you voted for or against it.<br><br><br><b>2022-03-31</b><br><br>-
                            Corrected an issue where tags longer than 50 characters would not fully
                            fit in an index table, making them only partially searchable in some
                            search modes.<br><br>- Corrected an issue where the excluded uploader
                            filter was not working for (recently uploaded) disowned

                            combination of CMYK and grayscale colorspaces. A workaround for this was
                            put in place.<br><br><br><b>2022-02-06</b><br><br>- Added a second

                            available. Since H@H only works over HTTPS, this has to use the site's
                            image servers, so like the old mode (now labeled "Modern/HTTPS"), this
                            is (bronze) donator only. This mode may or may not work in modern
                            browsers depending on type and security anality settings.<br><br>-

                            accuracy and subtracts 0.5 per percentage point below 85% accuracy, with

                                    - Improvements</b><br><br>- Added some significant optimizations
                                for a frequently used search strategy for when multiple
                                name+tag/comment search terms are used and at least one of the
                                name+tag terms has less than 10000 hits. (For some cases this will
                                reduce processing time by &gt;90%).<br><br>- The search query parser
                                will now handle various cases where repeated or redundant search
                                qualifiers are used, such as weak:tag:foo or

                                publish date adjustment for galleries created with the old uploaders
                                (predating October 2021) has been completed. This should fix the
                                remaining quirkiness with gallery sort placement as well as with the
                                seek/jump mechanism. Note that these galleries are now considered
                                "published" when the gallery was created rather than when it was
                                actually published, though in most cases this would only shift the
                                date by a few minutes to a few hours.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-17 -

                                search term was too short after being stripped of non-indexable
                                characters, the term was silently ignored. It now properly fails the
                                search with an error message instead.<br><br>- Fixed tags hidden
                                under My Tags not being displayed with search results when filters
                                are disabled.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-16 - Deployment +

                                Fixed an issue with how some dynamic stats were generated that only

                                    Fixes</b><br><br>- Fixed a bug in favorite searching where,
                                depending on internal state and order of operation, title-only
                                searches could break when multiple terms were used.<br><br>- The
                                wording of "default filters" was changed to "custom filters" to make
                                it clearer that it is referring to your personalized/customized tag,
                                uploader and language filters, rather than some global default
                                filter.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-13 - Minor Fixes</b><br><br>- Fixed
                                some more search issues with uploader usernames with leading or
                                trailing underscores as well as multiple consecutive
                                spaces/underscores.<br><br>- We now avoid using the /uploader/
                                shorthand URLs for uploader usernames containing forward slashes
                                since the resulting URLs are broken.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-11 -
                                    Minor Additions/Tweaks</b><br><br>- When searching for tags (or
                                titles+tags) where there is just one tag match and you have that tag
                                filtered, the system will now specifically ignore that filter. If
                                you actually want the tag filtered, you can use the title:
                                qualifier.<br><br>- The search engine will now stop looking for more
                                results for a page if more than 1000 galleries have been filtered.
                                (This is mostly relevant in edge cases where you are intentionally
                                searching for things you heavily filtered.)<br><br>- Fixed search
                                warnings not being displayed for favorite searches.<br><br>- Added a
                                setting to remove the "Your default filters removed XX galleries
                                from this page" message.<br><br>- Added a new qualifier "weak:" to
                                search for weak tags. This replaces the "Search Low-Power Tags"
                                checkbox. Using weak: in front of a keyword works the same as using
                                tag: except it will search weak tags (&lt;10 power) instead of
                                active (10+) ones.<br><br>This change allows for some additional
                                flexibility, since you can now search for various combinations of
                                weak tags and active tags - for example, all galleries with an
                                active parody tag from a particular series, and weak character tags
                                from said series.<br><br>Weak tags cannot be used for exclusions or
                                searched in favorites. Additionally, if you are using OR searches,
                                either all or none of the OR terms must use the weak: qualifier.<br><br>It
                                is not possible to search for both active and weak instances of the
                                same tag at the same time, or mix normal and weak OR terms in
                                general, since they use different indexes. These are not artificial
                                limitations. The weak tag search is there to aid in tagging and
                                cleanup in order to either get rid of them or make them into active
                                tags, not to get "more results" in casual browsing.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-07

                                an issue where some characters weren't properly stripped for name
                                index lookups.<br><br>- Corrected an issue where, when encountering
                                terms that were long enough to search but that contained characters
                                that are not valid in tags, it would still attempt to parse it as a
                                tag except with those characters stripped, but if there were less
                                than 3 stripped characters, it would then fail the term as being too
                                short. Terms with characters that cannot be used in tags are now
                                instead parsed as title-only unless a different qualifier is
                                used.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-06 - Minor Addition</b> <br><br>-

                                    - Update</b><br><br><b>New Feature: Seek/Jump Navigation</b><br><br>You
                                can now do arbitrary jumps (number of days/weeks/months/years)
                                backwards and forwards in search results, as well as arbitrary seeks
                                to a specific date in the search results, by clicking the new
                                Jump/Seek button in the navigation bar and entering a number or date
                                in the box that appears.<br><br>Entering a number will make it jump
                                backwards or forwards by the specified number of days, aligned to
                                the start or end of each day. Adding w, m or y to the number will
                                make it jump by that number of weeks, months or years instead. When
                                jumping forwards (Jump &gt;), the jump is based off the posted time
                                of the oldest (bottom-most) gallery on the current page. When
                                jumping backwards (&lt; Jump), the jump is based off the posted time
                                of the newest (topmost) gallery on the current page.<br><br>Entering
                                a date with the YYYY-MM-DD will make it seek to that date in the
                                search result (inclusive). Note that the semantics of &lt; Seek and
                                Seek &gt; is somewhat different than &lt; Next/Jump and Next/Jump
                                &gt; - specifically, which button you use determines whether it uses
                                the date as the starting point or the ending point.<br><br>You can
                                also use the YYYY-MM shorthand date. In this case, it will start
                                from the first day in the month when going backwards and the last
                                day in the month when going forward. (In other words, in either case
                                it will include that entire month.)<br><br>If you only enter a
                                number (not followed by d w m or y) and it is between 2007 and 2099,

                                    run a script to make some fixes to the publish timestamps to
                                    match the behavior of newer galleries. This correction will
                                    happen shorty after the update is fully

                                an issue where galleries were no longer displayed under favorites if
                                they are unavailable.<br><br>- Corrected an issue where, when using
                                the /tag/ URLs (such as when clicking tags from the gallery page),
                                it would keep adding additional quotes if you clicked the navigation
                                links.<br><br>- Corrected some issues with uploader usernames with
                                underscores and spaces. Note that for syntax and visual ambiguity
                                reasons, underscores and spaces are now considered equivalent in
                                uploader username searches.<br><br>- Corrected excluded categories
                                still appearing on the Popular Pane. (They are still supposed to
                                appear with file, gid and favorite searches.)<br><br>- Corrected a
                                potential issue where the file/gid searches weren't including
                                expunged galleries even though they were supposed to.<br><br>-
                                Corrected an issue with dashes/hyphens in name searches where they
                                weren't properly stripped for the index lookup.<br><br>- Corrected
                                an issue where if you were using advanced search and *only* picked a
                                minimum rating, the navigation wouldn't include it, so it would
                                reset between pages.<br><br><br><b>2022-11-01 - Original
                                    Post</b><br><br>This update is a complete rewrite of the gallery
                                search engine, meaning that the usage and behavior of searches has
                                changed in a number of more or less significant ways.<br><br>The
                                most significant and visible fundamental change is that the internal
                                segmenting of search results is now done by gallery ID (GID) ranges
                                rather than "pages". While this means jumping to an arbitrary "page"
                                in the result is no longer supported, this is arguably an
                                improvement since you can now jump to an arbitrary GID instead. This
                                also means each page of results will be fixed on the same set of
                                galleries even if it is refreshed after new galleries are added. The
                                page navigation has been reworked to reflect this.<br><br>This also
                                fundamentally fixes a long-standing issue where going backwards in
                                the results via the page navigation (as opposed to the browser back
                                button) would often include results from the following page if you
                                were using any form of filtering.<br><br>Overall, these changes
                                allow for massive performance improvements (three orders of
                                magnitude in some common cases) as well as significant new
                                functionality (keep reading), and there are no longer any limits to
                                how large a search result can be. Search terms that were previously
                                capped to 100,000 results (like say "big breasts" which is tagged on
                                350K+ galleries) can now be browsed in their entirety.
                                <br><br><br><b>OR Tag Searching</b><br><br>OR searching is now
                                supported for tags. (Probably the most requested feature of all
                                time.)<br><br>To use OR tag searching, prefix the keyword with ~<br><br>Example:
                                ~yuri ~"females only" ~f:sole_female$<br><br>Specifically, if you
                                have at least two keywords with the OR operator, the search will
                                return all galleries that contain at least one of the tags in
                                question. Using the OR operator will imply the tag: qualifier. If
                                you use it with any other qualifier that isn't a tag namespace, the
                                OR operator is ignored and the keyword will run as a standard AND
                                search.<br><br>Using OR searching will "consume" one of the allowed
                                inclusion search terms. If you only specify one OR term, it will be
                                treated as an AND tag-only term. There are no specific limits to how
                                many OR terms you can specify, though it will still be practically
                                limited by the search string length cap. It will additionally bail
                                if the overall OR search is matching more than 1000 tags internally,
                                so consider using exact tags to allow for more terms.<br><br>Wildcards
                                cannot be used for OR terms.<br><br><br><b>Exclude-Only
                                    Searching</b><br><br>You can now do exclude-only searches.
                                (Probably the other most requested feature of all time.)<br><br>Example:
                                -yaoi -m:footjob -"glory hole" -sole_male$ -title:"novel ai"
                                -comment:pixiv -uploader:BigDickDave69<br><br>You can use up to 10
                                comment+favnote exclusion terms and 10 tag (or hybrid tag+name)
                                exclusion terms in a search.<br><br>The gid, uploader, uploaduid and
                                title qualifiers are not specifically limited for exclusions, though
                                they will still be practically limited by the search string length
                                cap.<br><br><br><b>Tag Watching</b><br><br>The time cutoff for the
                                tag watching page has been significantly increased:<br><br>- For
                                non-donators, the cutoff was increased from one week to at least one
                                month. The exact cutoff depends on internal segmenting, the rate new
                                galleries are added, and the total index count for your watched
                                tags. It will generally be somewhere between one and six months.<br><br>-
                                For donators (gold star+), there are no longer any cutoffs. In other
                                words, you can browse and search watched tags back to the launch of
                                the site if you want. Note however that searching for terms that
                                have few matches in your watched tags may produce fewer than
                                expected results per page.<br><br><br><b>UI =&gt; Search Syntax
                                    Changes</b><br><br>The "Search Gallery Name", "Search Gallery
                                Tags" and "Search Gallery Description" checkboxes as well as the
                                corresponding search checkboxes on the Favorite page have all been
                                removed; this functionality is now part of the search syntax
                                instead.<br><br>By default, each search term will be interpreted as
                                a hybrid tag+title search, and will match the gallery name (both
                                english/romaji and japanese) as well as the gallery tags.<br><br>To
                                only match gallery names, prefix the term with the title:
                                qualifier<br>* Example: title:keyword -title:"string of
                                keywords"<br><br>To only match gallery tags, prefix the term with a
                                tag namespace, or tag: for all namespaces, or use the exact tag
                                operator $, or use the OR operator ~<br>* Example: f:"big breasts"
                                tag:group -futanari$ ~twintails<br><br>To search uploader gallery
                                comments, prefix the term with the comment: qualifier<br>* Example:
                                comment:"insightful uploader musings" -comment:"less insightful
                                ones"<br><br>Favorite searches only: To search favorite notes,
                                prefix the term with the favnote: qualifier<br>* Example:
                                favnote:"this is my favorite gallery" -favnote:"on the
                                citadel"<br><br>Note that this means combined
                                tag+name+comment/favnote search terms are no longer
                                supported.<br><br><br><b>Search Parsing Changes</b><br><br>- When
                                doing unquoted searches with unqualified short and/or non-indexable
                                words (a, an, ai, to, the, and, so, on, and so on), as well as some
                                common adjectives (small, big, huge, gigantic), they will now be
                                automatically appended or combined with the following
                                priority:<br><br>* If there is a non-qualified search term
                                immediately following the short word, it will be combined with that
                                one.<br><br>For example, searching for "a dick in a box" without
                                quotes will be searched as "a dick" "in a box". Everyone's new
                                favorite "ai generated" without quotes will be searched as if it had
                                quotes.<br><br>* If there is a non-qualified search term immediately
                                preceding the short word, it will be combined with that one.<br><br>For
                                example, searching for "novel ai" without quotes will be searched as
                                if it had quotes.<br><br>* If there are only short words, they will
                                be combined into one quoted word if there is more than one.<br><br>For
                                example, searching for "ex on the ox" without quotes will be
                                searched as if it had quotes. <br><br>* If there is just one short
                                word, or the short words are between qualified search terms, it will
                                be searched as an exact tag. A warning is printed in this
                                case.<br><br>For example, searching for "9s artist:a 2b" without
                                quotes will be searched as "tag:9s$" "artist:a$" "tag:2b$"<br><br>To
                                combine short words with a different priority, use quotes or
                                underscores. ("word1 word2 word3" and word1_word2_word3 are
                                equivalent.)<br><br>Note that there is a single two-character word
                                "3d" that was specifically whitelisted for title searches, but it is
                                not an indexable word for comment searches so it cannot be used for
                                that.<br><br>- Support for single-character wildcarding was dropped,
                                and the * wildcard can now only be used at the end of keywords.
                                Title, comment and favnote searches are implicitly wildcarded for
                                indexing reasons, so adding a wildcard will only affect tag
                                searching.<br><br><br><b>Search Term Limits</b><br><br>Exclusions
                                and inclusions now have separate limits. A query can have up to 5
                                name+tag inclusion terms, 10 name+tag exclusion terms, and 10
                                comment+favnote inclusion+exclusion terms.<br><br>For both
                                inclusions and exclusions, uploader:, uploadid: and gid: terms
                                aren't specifically limited, but would still be limited by the max
                                length of the search string (200 chars).<br><br>For exclusions,
                                title: terms are also not limited.<br><br><br><b>GID
                                    Searching</b><br><br>You can now use the gid: search qualifier
                                to search (publicly visible) galleries by Gallery ID. If you search
                                a GID that has been replaced, it will list the current gallery
                                instead.<br><br>Inclusion gid: terms cannot be combined with keyword
                                searches or used in watch mode. This does not apply to exclusion
                                terms. If used for exclusion, it will not exclude any galleries that
                                replaced the provided GID.<br><br>You can specify multiple gid:
                                terms in the same query for an implicit OR search.<br><br>This
                                search mode will show both normal and expunged galleries. Default
                                tag, language and uploader filters are automatically disabled for
                                these searches.<br><br><br><b>Result Counting</b><br><br>For
                                performance reasons, the search engine will no longer count the
                                exact number of results in large result sets; instead result counts
                                will usually be approximated based on various metrics. It will say
                                "about" if the count is an estimate.<br><br>For complex multi-term
                                searches with large result sets, it may not have enough information
                                to give a reasonable estimate. In these cases, rather than showing a
                                potentially wildly inaccurate one, it will just show "many". This
                                only affects the count readout, navigation for these search results
                                works the same as for smaller ones.<br><br>Smaller result sets (i.e.
                                those that fit on one page) should return the exact count in all
                                cases. Filtered galleries are included in this count, to match the
                                behavior for estimates.<br><br>The page range filter, exclusion
                                search terms and default language/uploader/tag filters will not
                                generally be reflected in approximate result count
                                estimates.<br><br>If you use the category, rating or torrent
                                filters, it will use precomputed adjustment factors to correct the
                                estimate. For some searches this estimate may be fairly inaccurate,
                                say if you search for terms that are mostly applicable for specific
                                categories then unselect other categories.<br><br>Result counts are
                                not displayed in favorite searches or on the popular page. In the
                                former case, it would only be able to display one for small result
                                sets, and in the latter, it's all one page of results anyway. You
                                can however still see the total for each favorite
                                category.<br><br><br><b>Tag Search Behavior</b><br><br>- Tag
                                searching now defaults to matching on word boundaries to reduce
                                unwanted matches. In other words, searching for "tag:mana" will
                                still match all tags that have "mana" as one of the words (like
                                "secret of mana" [=&gt; seiken densetsu] or "mana inuyama"), but it
                                does not match "manabe", "manatsu", "manami" and so on. Searching
                                for "tag:mana*" will restore the previous behavior.<br><br>- If
                                there are too many tag matches for a term, it will now automatically
                                rerun the term as an exact search instead of erroring out.<br><br>-
                                Selecting "Search Low-Power Tags" will now only search low-power
                                tags. This mode will also not do hybrid title/tag searches, so if a
                                term is left unqualified (i.e. "big breasts") it will only search
                                the tag. You can still search titles by using the title:
                                qualifier.<br><br>- The "Search Downvoted Tags" option was
                                removed.<br><br><br><b>Comment Search Behavior</b><br><br>Uploader
                                comments and favorite notes are now searched using the comment: and
                                favnote: qualifiers. favnote: is only available in favorite
                                searches.<br><br>The way comments are indexed have been
                                fundamentally changed, and there will be some subtle differences
                                between normal text searches and favorite + exclusion-only text
                                searches, since the former will usually use indexes while the latter
                                do not. <br><br>Most notably, some otherwise-searchable common words
                                (like "this" and "with") are not comment-searchable when the index
                                is used but will be searchable when it is not. Also, when the index
                                is used, words starting with these short words will not be matched
                                unless you search for that exactly (like "with" and "withhold").<br><br>Furthermore,
                                when the index is used it will only find word matches that start
                                with the string, but when it's not it will also find matches that
                                have the string as part of a word.<br><br>The index is only used for
                                normal inclusion comment searches, but even for those it may not be
                                used for some words and searches depending on various internal
                                factors and thresholds, so you should not rely on this behavior.<br><br><br><b>Other
                                    Changes</b><br><br>- Various issues and limitations with
                                favorite searches have been resolved. Searches in favorites should
                                now behave the same as normal searches except for the noted
                                comment/favnote search behavior.<br><br>- Exclusion searches for
                                titles, tags (except for exact tags), comments and favnotes will now
                                match any part of a word; i.e. -"laughter" will exclude "slaughter".<br><br>-
                                Indexes are now generally updated immediately when the underlying
                                data changes, which should reduce the delay until changes are
                                reflected in searches. (Due to caching, there can still be some
                                delay.)<br><br>- Whenever a gallery title has a mixed string of
                                unicode and latin characters without any spaces or other breakable
                                characters, like romaji漢字moreromaji, it would previously only be
                                searchable with terms starting with "rom...", "漢字..." and "字mo..".
                                It is now also searchable for "mor...".<br><br>- The "Your default
                                filters removed..." message is now more consistent and specifically
                                counts all galleries filtered by your default uploader, tag and
                                language search filter settings. (When using both filters and
                                exclusions and a gallery would have been removed by both, it is
                                counted as an exclusion.)<br><br>- Selecting "Search Expunged
                                Galleries" will now only search expunged galleries in normal
                                searches. (File searches, GID searches and favorite searches will
                                always display both normal and expunged galleries.)<br><br>- File
                                searches can no longer be combined with keyword searches or other
                                filters. This search mode will show both normal and expunged
                                galleries. Default tag, language and uploader filters are now
                                automatically disabled for these searches.<br><br>- Excessively
                                narrow page range filters (min &gt; 1000, max &lt; 10, min/max &gt;
                                0.8, min-max &lt; 20) are no longer allowed.<br><br>- The max number
                                of results per page is now 100. Paging Enlargement III was removed
                                and will be refunded Soon™.<br><br><br><b>Known
                                    Issues/Quirks/Complaints/Workingasintendedisms</b><br><br>-
                                <strike>You may sometimes see galleries appear out-of-order when
                                    going from one page to the next - in other words, going by the
                                    posted date, you would have expected the gallery to be on
                                    another page. This mostly applies to older galleries that
                                    predated the latest uploader update. This is because, prior to
                                    said update, a gallery could have been assigned a GID long
                                    before it was actually posted. This might eventually be
                                    addressed after a future redesign of the gallery metadata tables
                                    by renumbering galleries that are significantly out of
                                    order.</strike><br><br>- If you are browsing from the end of a
                                search results (backwards browsing mode) all the way to the start,
                                the "last" page in the result (the one with the oldest results) will
                                have a full page of results and the "first" page in the result (with
                                the most recent ones) will have the remainder. This is working as
                                intended.<br><br>- If you go backwards in a search result and get to
                                the "first" page (with the most recent results), the "&lt;&lt;
                                First" link will be lit up to flip back to the first page in
                                forwards browsing mode even if there are no further pages and "&lt;
                                Prev" is disabled. This is working as intended.<br><br>- If you
                                search for several AND inclusion tag terms (or hybrid title+tag
                                terms), where every term has many results (~10K+) and some have a
                                lot of results (~100K+), and there is a low degree of overlap
                                between the tags, you may see fewer than expected results per page.
                                You can usually use exact tags to avoid this.<br><br>- In general,
                                "results per page" should be considered a target rather than a
                                guarantee. For example, as an internal optimization, if a result
                                page is at least 95% full after a search cycle, it may return with a
                                couple of results "missing" instead of starting another search cycle
                                (which can be expensive). This does not mean it's withholding
                                results from you, you'll find them on the next page.<br><br>- "But
                                $tool/$script needs the ability to access arbitrary pages in search
                                results and/or accurate search result counts" is out of
                                scope/wontfix. Update it to use the new gid-based navigation. And
                                no, the old search engine was not "working just fine the way it
                                was", it was failing on an ever-increasing number of searches due to
                                running out of RAM when building results and badly needed a
                                fundamental redesign to cope with the ever-increasing size of the
                                index.<br><br><br>This is likely the most complicated update in the
                                site's history, so there will probably be bugs and other subtle
                                behavioral changes. Please don't hestiate to ask whether something
                                is intentional if it's not noted in these patch notes.

                            <div class="newstext">After some internal discussion followed by a
                                public debate, we have gone ahead and added a new expunge reason
                                named "Defaced" with the following description:<br><br>"Content has
                                been defaced by adding content-obstructing scanmarks, censorship or
                                advertisements beyond what is present in the original artist
                                release, or has been intentionally degraded to the point where
                                legibility is an issue."<br><br>Since this expunge type has a
                                subjective element, you need a mod power of at least 20 to start
                                this type of expunge petition. It won't show in the list if you have
                                less.<br><br>"Degraded" includes any sort of intentional bad-faith
                                sabotage of the core content, including but not limited to excessive
                                downsampling, blurring, pixelation etc, as well as leaving out core

                                expunge type does not contribute towards the automatic temporary
                                upload ban.<br><br>Expunge type filtering was also added to the
                                expunge tracker as part of this addition, along with some other
                                minor filtering improvements.

                            <div class="newsdate">Posted Wednesday, 1st of December 2021, 09:56
                                UTC

                            <div class="newstext">For various reasons, primarily to help prevent
                                some issues with searching in the "misc" namespace, we decided to
                                make some changes to the tag namespacing. Essentially, this involves
                                making new namespaces for all "approved" tags. The "misc" namespace
                                has been renamed to "temp" to emphasize that it is only used for
                                "unapproved" or temporary tags.<br><br>The new namespaces are as
                                follows:<br><br><b><u>mixed (x)</u></b>: holds mixed-gender fetish
                                tags<br>- e.g. group, mmf threesome, ffm threesome, body swap,
                                multiple assjob<br>⠀<br><b><u>other (o)</u></b>: holds approved
                                technical tags<br>- e.g. compilation, novel, mosaic censorship, 3d,
                                animated, full color, multi-work series<br>⠀<br><b><u>cosplayer
                                    (cos)</u></b>: holds existing and future cosplayer tags<br>- If
                                the cosplayer consistently uses a name order, use that. Otherwise,
                                follow the name order of the cosplayer's country.<br>⠀<br>While the
                                "temp" namespace is for all intents and purposes identical to the
                                old "misc" namespace, in the future there may be some changes to the
                                search mechanics for this namespace, as well as a more aggressive
                                pruning mechanism whenever all the current tags have been migrated
                                to the "approved" namespaces. We will get back to that at a later
                                date.<br><br>Note that you may see some inconsistencies in the tag
                                pane due to caching whenever a tag is moved. That should
                                automatically fix itself when the cache expires or any tag is added
                                or voted on.<br><br>Let me know if you encounter any issues that
                                AREN'T "(tag) still shows up as as (old namespace) on (gallery)".

                                uploader servers have now been deployed, which will eventually
                                replace the current uploaders that were deployed six years ago.
                                These new servers also come with a new major release of the uploader
                                interface. While they have been in closed beta testing for the last
                                week or so, I decided to run a public beta as well before switching
                                to the new servers entirely.<br><br>The new servers run new major
                                versions of pretty much everything, the internals of the uploader
                                have been significantly reworked, and it also uses the new core
                                library that was first added to the previous version of HV, so
                                please be on the lookout for any issues.<br><br>Uploads may
                                temporarily be somewhat slower than before, since files have to also
                                sync over to the old uploaders for this initial release. When the
                                old uploaders have been phased out, this will go back to normal.<br><br>Unpublished
                                galleries that were added on the old uploaders will not show up on
                                the new ones until they have been imported, which will happen some
                                time after the new uploaders go fully live. The old uploaders will
                                be available until then.<br><br>Similarly, galleries added or
                                versioned (cloned) on the new uploaders will not show up on the old
                                ones, though there was a check added to prevent a gallery from being
                                versioned on both the new and old uploaders.<br><br><br><b>New
                                    Features</b><br><br>- Added time-based auto-sorting that allows
                                you to easily resort a gallery to have newly added files first (or
                                last) without having to manually reorder them, which is a common
                                task for updated image galleries.<br><br>This uses the publish time
                                for the gallery in the chain each file first appears in, and is only
                                applicable for versioned (cloned) galleries. Note that the order the
                                files were uploaded in for a given gallery in the chain does not
                                matter for this sort as it goes by which gallery it was first added
                                to, but you can keep the current order within each set of files.<br><br>-
                                Added an "auto-sort" method called "Remove Exact Duplicates" which,
                                as the name implies, will remove duplicated files from the gallery.
                                The first file in the current page order will be preserved.<br><br>The
                                available methods are now:<br>* Remove exact duplicate files from
                                the gallery<br>* Sort based on natural or lexical ordering of the
                                filenames, ignoring when they were added. (These are the old
                                methods.)<br>* Sort based on the time a file was first added to a
                                chain of galleries, using either a Recent First (descending) or
                                Recent Last (ascending) sort. It can then either keep the current
                                sort order within each set of files, or do an additional natural or
                                lexical sort based on the filenames.<br><br><br>- Added the option
                                to "disown" any published gallery. This will remove the gallery from
                                the uploader interface, remove the uploader link/readout from the
                                gallery, and prevent the gallery from being found with an uploader
                                search.<br><br>You will not be able to make (or request) changes to
                                a gallery after disowning it. You will however continue gaining
                                toplist points and GP from disowned galleries.<br><br>You cannot
                                disown a gallery before it has been fully published ("Visible"
                                changes from "Soon"). Recently published disowned galleries will
                                still show the uploader for a week after being published.<br><br>Note
                                that expunged galleries will now also be "disowned" rather than
                                "deleted". "Deleting" published galleries is never possible anymore.
                                Unpublished galleries will still be erased as before.<br><br><br>-
                                When creating a new gallery, you can now set the initial language
                                for the gallery directly on the uploader screen. This will
                                automatically create Autotagger tags for that language on the
                                gallery when it is published.<br><br>For an already published or
                                versioned (cloned) gallery, it will still show the currently active
                                language based on the current tags, but you will not be able to
                                change it from the uploader interface.<br><br>Before anyone tries to
                                argue whether a language should be "common" or not, the selection
                                list is dynamically generated and is purely based on the number of
                                galleries using the tag for the language.<br><br>To prevent
                                excessive clutter, languages with less than 5 tagged galleries are
                                not included in the list. Any new language tags are automatically
                                added to the list when they reach 5 tagged galleries.<br><br>If the
                                category is set to "Image Set", the language is ignored if it is set
                                to "Speechless" or "Text Cleaned". Similarly, if the category is set
                                to "Game CG", the language is ignored if it is set to "Speechless".
                                Note that it allows you to set it, it's just ignored when
                                publishing.<br><br><br>- A new image previewer for unpublished
                                galleries was added, primarily because galleries now only "exist" in
                                the uploader until they are published. This will always use the
                                1280x resamples if available for the image, originals otherwise.<br><br>While
                                previewing an image, you can use right arrow/numpad or D to go to
                                the next page, and left arrow/numpad or A for the previous page. You
                                can also close the image preview with spacebar. <br><br>Unlike the
                                preview on the old uploaders, this preview will immediately mirror
                                any file order changes or deletions, so you should be able to
                                quickly check the new page order before saving the
                                changes.<br><br><br><b>Changes and Fixes</b><br><br>- The way
                                unpublished galleries are stored in the system was fundamentally
                                changed; among other things, this fixes a problem where galleries
                                that were created a long time before they were published would
                                "bypass" the Watched page.<br><br>- After publishing, a gallery now
                                have an explicit "processing" state while some final background
                                tasks take place, where they are fully functional except that some
                                thumbnail variants aren't generated yet. They can be accessed (and
                                tagged) if you have the link, but aren't yet publicly
                                listed.<br><br>- Thumbnails are now pushed to the standard thumbnail
                                servers immediately rather than as a scheduled background job. The
                                uploader thumbnail servers will be retired together with the old
                                uploaders, and the "Asia delay" will be removed when this is
                                done.<br><br>- Reworked some of the mechanisms to prevent excessive
                                expunge posters and new gallery posters from spamming the system.
                                Among other things, this check now happens at publish time rather
                                than gallery creation time.<br><br>- You can now create a maximum of
                                250 upload folders. Note that if you are one of the 18 people who
                                currently have more than this, you might want to consolidate folders
                                manually, as any excess folders may be dropped in a future update,
                                setting those galleries as "Unsorted".<br><br>- You can now have a
                                maximum of 1000 unpublished galleries.<br><br>- Unpublished
                                galleries will now be deleted 1 year after they were last touched.
                                Older unpublished galleries will have a moratorium of 1 year from
                                the time they are imported to the new system.<br><br>- Corrected an
                                issue where restrictive/broken permissions for files in ZIP archives
                                could prevent files from being included. Note that filenames in ZIP
                                files still have to be unique across any subdirectories, otherwise
                                only one of the files with the same filename will be
                                included.<br><br>- Support for RAR archive files has been
                                dropped.<br><br><strike>- The same exact file can now only appear in
                                    a gallery once, mostly to prevent any lingering issues with
                                    accidentally starting multiple uploads at the same time. This is
                                    not retroactive to old published galleries, but if an old
                                    published gallery is cloned and when an old unpublished gallery
                                    is imported to the new system, any duplicate files will be
                                    removed.</strike><br><br>- The same exact file with the same
                                exact filename can now only appear in a gallery once, mostly to
                                prevent any lingering issues with accidentally starting multiple
                                uploads at the same time. This is not retroactive to old published
                                galleries, but if an old published gallery is versioned/cloned, any
                                duplicate files with the same exact filename will be removed; a
                                warning will be printed in this case. Old unpublished galleries will
                                also have any duplicated pages with identical file+name removed when
                                imported to the new system<br><br>- When trying to access a replaced
                                gallery in the uploader, it will now forward you to the current
                                (published or unpublished) version of the gallery.<br><br>- The
                                readout for "Child Gallery" on the manage screen was never actually
                                used since older versions of a gallery could never be "managed", and
                                was removed.<br><br>- "Standard Sort" was renamed "Lexical Sort" to
                                be less ambiguous.<br><br>- Galleries that are being
                                updated/replaced are now still shown in the uploader list until the
                                replacement is published, and will have a link to the replacement
                                gallery.<br><br>- The category selector was moved, and the "make
                                public" checkbox was removed in favor of a separate option in the
                                selector drop-down.<br><br>- Actions that are no longer available on
                                a gallery (such as changing the category or name on non-recently
                                published galleries) are now grayed out instead of just returning an
                                error if you were to try to change them.<br><br>- Other minor UI
                                tweaks and fixes.
